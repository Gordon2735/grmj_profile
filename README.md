## Principle Software Utilized || Fullstack

1. TypeScript/JavaScript/HTML/CSS
2. Node.js
3. Express
4. Handlebars
5. Jest
6. MongoDB with Mongoose
7. Github/Version Control/Repository
8. Markdown/Documentation

### Development Convention Utilized

1. MVC Architecture for Server
2. Native Web Component Architecture for UI Dynamic
3. No-Framework/No-Library for UI/Frontend Development
4. Server-Side Rendering Node.js/Express-Handlebars
5. Persistency with MongoDB/Mongoose for Database Dynamic
6. Jest for Unit Testing / Partial TDD (Test Driven Development)

#### Development Strategy

1.  Engineering a loosely coupled, modular design, with a focus on code reusability and maintainability.
2.  Object-Oriented-Programming (OOP); using classes, inheritance, and encapsulation, but favoring composition over inheritance.
3.  Using Native Web Components dynamically for the entirety of the UI/Frontend Development structurally driven within the OOP paradigm and utilizing the ES6 module system.
4.  Also, the ES6 module system is used for the Server-Side Rendering Node.js/Express-Handlebars.
5.  I have found that the ES6 module system is the most efficient and effective way to develop a modular design in a Node.js/Express-Handlebars environment. It took a lot of trial and error to get to this point, but I am very happy with the results.
6.  Using TypeScript for the entirety of the development.
7.  Scripting, minifying, and uglifying will be accomplished in the package.json file.
8.  ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript tools for linting and formatting, and for the TypeScript compiler. Clean, refactored code is a development practice and standard.
9.  Integration of the Jest testing framework for unit testing.
10. Progressive software development, regarding industry standards, and best practices. I am always learning and improving my skills.
11. A desired goal in this combination of technologies is to achieve a 100% score on the Lighthouse Audit done aggressively with a regular cadence and continuance reporting within Google's Lighthouse Environment using Puppeteer for the PDF Documentation of the Lighthouse Audit.
12. Considering a total integration of these software development technologies, we realize the natural tendency of gravitating toward complexity. Therefore with determination, our attitude toward this development project will strive for the least possible complexity; and endeavour reaching determined goals with the modest possible simplicity. This is the goal of the project's development strategy.
