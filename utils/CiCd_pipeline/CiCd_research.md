# Continuous Delivery Pipeline

## Introduction

Continuous Delivery is a software development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested and prepared for a release to production. It aims at building, testing, and releasing software with greater speed and frequency. The approach helps reduce the cost, time, and risk of delivering changes by allowing for more incremental updates to applications in production.

## Continuous Delivery Pipeline

A Continuous Delivery Pipeline is a set of automated processes that take code from a version control system and deploy it to a production environment. It is a model of software delivery that automates the build, test, and release processes. The pipeline is a collection of stages that are executed in sequence. Each stage is a collection of steps that are executed in parallel. The pipeline is triggered by a code commit or a manual trigger.

## Continuous Delivery Pipeline Stages

The Continuous Delivery Pipeline is composed of the following stages:

-   Build

-   Test

-   Release

-   Deploy

-   Monitor

## Build Stage

The build stage is the first stage of the pipeline. It is responsible for compiling the source code into a binary or package that can be deployed to a target environment. The build stage is usually triggered by a code commit. The build stage is composed of the following steps:

-   Checkout source code from the version control system

-   Compile the source code

-   Package the compiled code

-   Run unit tests

-   Run static code analysis

-   Run code coverage

-   Run security scans

-   Run performance tests

-   Run integration tests

-   Run functional tests

-   Run load tests

-   Run smoke tests

-   Run acceptance tests

-   Run regression tests

-   Run end-to-end tests

-   Run user acceptance tests

-   Run exploratory tests

-   Run accessibility tests

-   Run localization tests

-   Run compatibility tests

-   Run interoperability tests

-   Run usability tests

-   Run stress tests

-   Run reliability tests

-   Run performance tests

-   Run scalability tests

-   Run security tests

-   Run penetration tests

-   Run fuzz tests

-   Run vulnerability tests

-   Run compliance tests

-   Run configuration tests

-   Run installation tests

-   Run upgrade tests

-   Run downgrade tests

-   Run migration tests

-   Run rollback tests

-   Run recovery tests

-   Run disaster recovery tests

-   Run failover tests

-   Run failback tests

-   Run failover tests

## Test Stage

The test stage is the second stage of the pipeline. It is responsible for testing the compiled code. The test stage is usually triggered by a successful build. The test stage is composed of the following steps:

-   Run unit tests

-   Run static code analysis

-   Run code coverage

-   Run security scans

-   Run performance tests

-   Run integration tests

-   Run functional tests

-   Run load tests

-   Run smoke tests

-   Run acceptance tests

-   Run regression tests

-   Run end-to-end tests

-   Run user acceptance tests

-   Run exploratory tests

-   Run accessibility tests

-   Run localization tests

-   Run compatibility tests

-   Run interoperability tests

-   Run usability tests

-   Run stress tests

-   Run reliability tests

## Release Stage

The release stage is the third stage of the pipeline. It is responsible for preparing the compiled code for deployment. The release stage is usually triggered by a successful test. The release stage is composed of the following steps:

-   Create a release package

-   Create a release notes

-   Create a release tag

-   Create a release branch

-   Create a release build

-   Create a release candidate

-   Create a release candidate build

-   Create a release candidate package

-   Create a release candidate notes

-   Create a release candidate tag

-   Create a release candidate branch

## Deploy Stage

The deploy stage is the fourth stage of the pipeline. It is responsible for deploying the compiled code to a target environment. The deploy stage is usually triggered by a successful release. The deploy stage is composed of the following steps:

-   Deploy to a development environment

-   Deploy to a staging environment

-   Deploy to a test environment

-   Deploy to a production environment

-   Deploy to a sandbox environment

-   Deploy to a pre-production environment

-   Deploy to a QA environment

-   Deploy to a UAT environment

-   Deploy to a demo environment

-   Deploy to a training environment

-   Deploy to a pilot environment

## Monitor Stage

The monitor stage is the fifth stage of the pipeline. It is responsible for monitoring the deployed code. The monitor stage is usually triggered by a successful deploy. The monitor stage is composed of the following steps:

-   Monitor the deployed code

-   Monitor the deployed application

-   Monitor the deployed service

-   Monitor the deployed infrastructure

-   Monitor the deployed environment

-   Monitor the deployed database

-   Monitor the deployed network

-   Monitor the deployed server
