            Personal Goals:
            <br />
            Current-Best-Practices-Driven JavaScript Software Engineering combining a loosely coupled, modular design;
            with a focus on code reusability and maintainability. Object-Oriented-Programming (OOP): using classes while
            seeking non-complexity though standardizing with Encapsulation, Abstraction, Polymorphism, and Inheritance;
            progressively favoring composition over inheritance. Using Native Web Components dynamically for the
            entirety of the UI/Frontend Development Process. Applying constraints for maintaining a structured OOP/MVC
            paradigm including the Components "state", and utilizing the ES6 module system: even within the Node.js
            Environment for consistency. Unit-Testing Front & Backend with the Testing frameworks of Jest, and
            Supertest. Always seeking to improve my programming skills and knowledge. Deep-Diving invariably into
            JavaScript/TypeScript so that if, hypothetically I were cornered, then asked to describe my coding skills
            permitting only two words, I would impulsively reply without hesitation: 'JavaScript Professional'.
