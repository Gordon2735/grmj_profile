### **Guidelines to Extensibility**

---

    -   Deep-Dive and Research the depths of Persistent Extensibility!
    -   Develop the ability to communicate dexterously of Native Web Component's powerful
            "Built-In-the-Browser" dynamic Version-Proof Extensibility!
    -   Study the maintenance issues inherited from using the industry's major popular frameworks:
            taking this compilation and comparing its woes against the more positive, powerful, and
            "Extensible" nature of Native Web Components.
    -   Master how Web Components inherently render Production's Administration and Maintenance
            much less problematic; while manifesting a more intuitive and streamlined developmental
            experience, which is far less painful and met with considerably less reluctance as well.
    -   Research Native Web Component's strengths along with their "Scalability" and "Reusability"!
    -   Engineering Contemplation has me obsessed & thirsting after a maintenance schedule free of
            stress and worry over the next version implementation of a tool I used in development.
            GREAT THING with Web Components are their extensibility allowing me to DRIVE-FAST-FORWARD
            through all the version-change-commotion! Sweat free with every new edition and release.
            Garnishing Liberty and attaching a 'versionary-stress-free' existence, obtained
            with having used an 'INSIDE' Web Standard tool: a tool that's built right into the browser.
            As much as ECMA intentionally and tirelessly reaches for backward compatibility with every
            release cycle, Ive purposefully migrated this portion of stress responsibility
            over to the other guy: shame on me for doing that , uh? And ECMA does a fantastic job
            of making sure our old JavaScript code will still work properly with every release.
            NOW THERE's EXTENSIBILITY that can't be beat! I can't 'reason why' everybody and
            their brothers haven't switch to Web Components for this very reason alone.
            Considering React, which I've never used, I guess there's love affairs,
            and then there are LOVE-AFFAIRS. I wanted to DEEP-DIVE into JavaScript and
            learn it inside and out before I acquiesce and gave into the JavaScript World's
            'developer framework fad'. I'm not putting it down mind you, because I'm sure it can speed up
            the development. Notwithstanding, I perceive that in a consistent Vanilla JavaScript
            development environment, that the resourceful developer would create a LIBRARY
            of reusable modules and snippets, which would then engender a rapid-fire environment
            of speedy development. Furthermore, the expertise cleaned from a frameworkless methodology
            would tweak the engineers problem-solving etiquette and lift him towards engineering nobility.
            This, after much agonizing turmoil, including a Functional, Object Oriented,
            nocturnal-neurological suffering, and an intrusive cardiovascular pain: a derived
            Myocardial infarction with a genesis born out of a focal point of DEADLINES: lol.

### **Using CSS Custom Properties**

---

    -   Custom Properties have the ability to access the interior of the application's various
            implementations of "ShadowRoot(ShadowDOM)" or "LightDOM's" segments within the
            DOM(Document Object Model).
    -   Reestablish and reroute the app's CSS implementations subscribing a ":root {}" source for CSS Custom Properties,
            then orchestrated without complexity within an index.css file!

### **Contemplate a Design for Templating a Model for Interfacing sharedHTML & sharedStyles**

---

    -   Intention to Create a Template of ONE Interface for the sharedStyles & sharedHTML
    -   Thinking ahead before REFACTORING the Application
    -   Maintain the DRY(Don't-Repeat-Yourself) Principle in Software Development
