            "Gordon's place of origin was in the South Carolina city of Aiken",
            "Has an army brat Gordon's younger years was full of travels; and probably more so than in his later years",
            "Fort Gordon and Fort Stewart as well as Savannah Georgia were some of the earlier travels: and let's not forget the 'Most-Notoriously-Popular' of the Georgia Forts, Fort Benning",
            "Moving on from there we can scratch another notch in our travel-tree for Fort Campbell Kentucky and another for Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas",
            "We can carve an especially deep notch for the Army's Helicopter Capital of Forts: Fort Rucker Alabama. This deep notch reveals a multiplicity of branches intertwined and passing through this Fort.",
            "Let us add a special notch for Fort Leavenworth Kansas and its great rolling hills that were ideal for snow sledding.",
            "With excitement the family pushed on from Kansas and following the Oregon Trail(joking) out to Fort McArthur California which pushed against the magical Pacific Ocean.",
            "It was here in the Los Angeles fast lane that my father received his Master's Degree in Computer Science at the University of Southern California.",
            "He had taken a leave of absence from the Army (though it still counted has time served) in 1970. Strategically, together with one of his best friends",
            "who had taken a break from NASA (this was right after Apollo 12's first mission to the moon), attended the University together.",
            "I remember visiting their family at Cape Canaveral, Florida just six months before the Apollo 12 mission. I was only 10 years old at the time and totally enamoured with the Apollo space program.",
            "As if it were yesterday, I remember standing upon a platform, which was close to the ceiling of the big NASA building located close to the launch site,",
            "and peering down the length of the Saturn V rocket being assembled within. It was a sight to behold. I was in awe of the size of the rocket and the fact that it was going to the moon.",
            "I was almost excited with the rocket as I was with a very pretty new friend who happened to be a neighbor of the family we were visiting.",
            "She and I were having a great time together while swimming daily in our friends pool; which paralleled a beautiful canal, which was only twenty feet away from the pool, and opened up into the wonderful Atlantic Ocean.",
            "Stricken with nostalgia, I reminisce of her long sandy blond hair and her beautiful smile. I can positively project what would have happened if only I were living there; ah ah!",
            "I digress: escaping memory lane I can still name the avenue our house in Redondo Beach was located on; Evelyn Ave",
            "Stephen Crabtree was my best friend and on my t-ball team, and together we experienced for the first time losing a good friend to a tragic traffic accident.",
            "This is totally unbelievable, but a flood of forgotten memories are manifesting in waves of personal emotions and seeming as if misplaced. Wow, unbelievable still!",
            "I have to move on or burst out in tears, sorry. Unbelievable!",

            "Sadly, after my father's graduation, we saw him off at the Los Angeles International Airport, as he began his second tour in Vietnam; 1972 towards the end.",
            "My father, who rarely ever spoke to me of his experiences during the war, said to me many years later: ",
            "we knew it was lost. Also, that all we had accomplished and sacrificed had been in vain. He spoke of a Captain that had died under his command while piloting a Huey UH-1 helicopter.",
            "That many of his pilots arrived in Nam with a lack of 'Instrument-Training'. They were slack in available pilots so they rushed them over anyway, despite the lack of preparedness.",
            "My dad, in so many words, expressed this Captains death had been in vain having happened so near the end of the war. That, and the fact they had deployed him in harms-way hurriedly. ",
            "He perished in a single helicopter crash that had occurred during Vietnam's rainy season and absent of any enemy fire.",
            "What to tell his family? Dear so and so, we are sorry to have to inform you of the death of Captain So & So; your husband, your son.",
            "Sorry to report to you that he was not valiant and did not die in a hail of withering enemy fire: he would have been our hero.",
            "No, with regret we report that he had died by his own miserable hand. While piloting a UH-1 rotary-wing aircraft, he entered a thickly overcast airspace while practicing low-level-flying within a geographically mountainous area of operations.",
            "Adding to your misery, it is my duty to inform you that he was included at the last minute in the deployment of my flight group.",
            "We knew that he had not finished his training in 'Instrument Flying' which exacerbated conditions for his premature death. ",
            "Without the proper training in instruments, a pilot is constrained to a VFR (Visual Flight Rules) qualification.",
            "It is recommended, and actually mandated, that every pilot have IFR (Instrument Flight Rules) qualifications, in order to fly operational missions.",
            "Adhering to this mandate, Captain So & So was practicing his low-level-flying skills and learning Instruments in order to qualify for Normal Operations.",
            "He, with three others aboard his aircraft, inadvertently flew into a cloud bank and became disoriented. He was unable to recover from the situation and crashed into the side of a mountain.",
            "I lost good men trying to help Captain So & So with his qualifications. The sorrowful truth of this tragedy must be made manifest and apparent to all concerned:",
            "for the family members and especially to the Army Command that's orchestrating and responsible for these senseless deaths and tragedies.",
            "The Command knowingly and willfully sent him into harms way without the proper training and qualifications. They knew he was not ready for deployment.",
            "Despite this knowledge, and due to inferior numbers of qualified pilots, they sent unqualified pilots into harms way in order to meet scheduled company roster billets.",
            "The family truly needed to know this version of the truth. Instead, they received a watered-down letter of feel-good condolence that felt like a lie as I wrote it.",
            "I would have lost my wings and commission had I written the full truth of what happened.",
            "Anyway, my dad ended the conversation by saying, 'gee son, we all knew it was winding down and we were close to the end",
            "Not one of us wanted to be there. We were all just trying to get home alive. I guess we all all felt a guilty for it, but we just wanted to get the __ll out of there and go home.'",

            "Notwithstanding and overcoming the digression, we continue the journey. While my father upheld his responsibilities and duties in Vietnam, my mother became a Southern California rising star!.",
            "During my dad's university studies, my mother had studies of her own; Real Estate Licensing.",
            "She was a natural and quickly became a top producer in the star-studded, California lifestyle, and the growing RealEstate industry of 1971.",
            "Finally, my father returned, after we all had met him mid-way thru his tour: R & R (Rest and Relaxation) they called it.",
            "We flew a brand new 747 Jumbo Jet to Hawaii and had one the best weeks of my life! Wow, what a trip!",
            "On the return flight I consoled my mother as she and I listened to Don Ho singing 'Tiny Bubbles' thru our headsets.",
            "We arrived in Newport News, Virginia in the summer of 1973. I'd have to say that Newport News was at my 'top of list' for Duty Stations. ",
            "It was there, Fort Monroe, Virginia, in 1976 that my father retired from the Army after twenty-four years of service.",
            "He was hurt and a little angered that he didn't make Full-Bird Colonel. He was a Lieutenant Colonel at the time of his retirement,",
            "and would have remained commissioned, but advancement to Colonel was not in the cards while the Post-Vietnam US Military was in the middle 0f a major downsizing.",
            "Besides, he really didn't want a desk job anyway; that wasn't really him. He wanted to fly",
            "He hadn't flown for over four years and he was itching to get back in the pilots seat.",
            "He almost went down to the Gulf of Mexico to fly for the oil companies, but he decided to stay close to the Army and train their new pilots; Fort Rucker, Alabama, here we come again!",
            "My mother wasn't too excited about another round of Fort Rucker, but she acquiesced; only because two of her children had been born on the base itself: Elizabeth and Stewart. ",
            "My dad went down first and found a rental house in Ozark, ALabama as my mom stayed behind to wrap up the selling of my favorite house on 747 Village Green Pkwy in Newport News, Virginia.",
            "The telephone number in my favorite house was 804-877-0101 and I did not want to move to an ol'e hick town populated with a bunch of Alabama rednecks. No way Jose!",
            "I was fourteen, almost fifteen, and loved it there with all my friends and girl friends. I was tired of moving and di not want to go.",
            "Lo and behold, away we went and arrived in Ozark, Alabama, in the year of our Lord, One thousand, nine-hundred, and seventy-six.",
            "And it was the end of the world to me. Nevertheless, I adapted, recovered, and overcame. I made new friends and found a new girlfriend.",
            "Who knows their personal destiny anyway? Is it preordained, or is our personal predestination written in the stars? Or is it a matter of chance, decisions, and circumstance?",
            "It is what it is, dad-nabit, and I'm going to make the best of it. I'm going to be the best I can be and I'm going to be a success.",
            "Furthermore, I fell in love with computer programming and made it a personal goal and number one on my Bucket-List, to be the best dad-nab developer possible!",
            "I'm not a spring chicken anymore, notwithstanding, I've a feel for it and it feels natural to me: it builds upon my skills and talents.",
            "I've wanted to to it for over thirty years, but family and ministerial responsibilities made it impossible.",
            "Thank-goodness, here we are! I've studied night and day for almost two years and I'm ready to go! I'm ready to be the best dad-nab developer possible!",
            "So, I have an aspiration anew, and it incorporates an addendum to this journey and life travels registered here.",
            "I pray to write the new address, of my new residence, in the city where my first employment in software development and new employer have set up camp: DESTINY!"
